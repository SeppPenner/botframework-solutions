## Tutorial: Create a Virtual Assistant

### Purpose
Install Bot Framework development prerequisites and create your first Virtual Assistant.

### Prerequisites
- Azure Subscription
- LUIS Authoring Key
    - Review the [LUIS regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-reference-regions) documentation page for the correct LUIS portal for the region you plan to deploy to. Note that www.luis.ai refers to the US region and an authoring key retrieved from this portal will not work within a Europe deployment.
    - Once signed in replace your name in the top right hand corner.
    - Choose Settings and make a note of the Authoring Key for the next step.

### Time To Complete
