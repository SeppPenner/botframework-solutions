## Intro

### Purpose

The Virtual Assistant template creates and deploys an Assistant with all speech enablement steps provided out of the box.

This tutorial covers the steps required to connect the [Direct Line Speech channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/directline-speech-bot?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) to your assistant and build a simple application integrated with the Speech SDK to demonstrate Speech interactions working.

### Prerequisites

- [Create a Virtual Assistant](/docs/tutorials/csharp/virtualassistant.md) to setup your environment.

- Make sure the `Universal Windows Platform development` workload is available on your machine. Choose **Tools > Get Tools** and Features from the Visual Studio menu bar to open the Visual Studio installer. If this workload is already enabled, close the dialog box.

### Time to Complete

10 minutes
